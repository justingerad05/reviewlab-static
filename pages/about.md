# About ReviewLab

ReviewLab is an independent software evaluation platform focused on AI tools, automation systems, and productivity technology.

Our mission is simple:

**Help readers choose software that genuinely improves workflow, revenue, or efficiency.**

No anonymous authors.  
No automated scoring engines.  
No paid rankings.
